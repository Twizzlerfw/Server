# Thanks for downloading my plugin SwearReplacer!
# 
# This config is really easy to use. All you gotta do is put the word you want to be replaced, followed by a semicolon, then the word you want to replace it with. Like this:
# Word;OtherWord
# 
# You can even use multiple words in both bits, like:
# Thing to be replaced;Thing you're replacing it with
# 
# The ones below are examples. Feel free to change them. (I suggest you do as that's kinda the point of the plugin xD)

replacements:
- Word/sHere;ReplacementHere
- Can even be multiple words;Replacement Here
- shit;s***
- fuck;f***
- bitch;b***
- dahn;D***
- damn;D***
- damnit;D***
- dangit;d******
- lag;My Computer Is Slo
- twz;Sir
- wtf;wt*
- dick;d***
- stfu;I AM DUMB
- fart;I Fart A lot
